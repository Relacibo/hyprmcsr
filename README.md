## Overview

**hyprmcsr** is a toolkit for automating a modern Minecraft speedrunning environment on Linux, with a focus on performance, usability, and automation.  
It is especially useful for runners looking for a streamlined, performant alternative to the typical Windows-based MCSR setup.

The toolkit leverages [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) (Wayland compositor), Pipewire, PrismLauncher, and various helper tools to provide:
- Automated setup and download/update of all desired tools, such as Ninjabrain-bot, Paceman-tracker, etc.
- Automated window size management
- Configurable keybinds and window sizes
- Multiple profiles support
- Audio splitting (game / Discord)
- Automated start of all necessary tools when you begin a speedrunning session, including Minecraft, input remapper, OBS, and your speedrun helper tools
- Automated closing and cleanup after ending your session

All core functionality is controlled via the `hyprmcsr` CLI, which manages setup, teardown, and automation for your speedrun sessions.
