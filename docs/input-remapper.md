# Input Remapper

hyprmcsr uses [input-remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper) to automatically remap keys and mouse buttons for optimal speedrunning.

- To open the graphical interface, run `input-remapper-gtk` in a terminal. There you can create device profiles and set up hotkeys.
- Device profiles are set in your profile config.
- Remapping is enabled on start and disabled on destroy.
- No manual intervention required.

**Tip:**  
Make sure your user is in the `input` group and you have `sudo` permissions for input-remapper.
