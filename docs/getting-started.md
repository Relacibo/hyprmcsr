# Getting Started

Welcome to **hyprmcsr** â€“ the Linux Minecraft speedrunning automation toolkit!

This documentation will guide you through the setup and usage of hyprmcsr on a modern Linux system with Hyprland.

- For a general Linux MCSR guide, see [linux-mcsr by Saanvi](https://its-saanvi.github.io/linux-mcsr/).
  Most sections are relevant for this toolkit as well, **except** for the parts about Resetti, audio stream splitting, keymap rebinds, and configuring i3 or GNOME on Xorg. 
  These aspects are either handled differently or automatically by hyprmcsr, which is designed for Wayland (Hyprland).
